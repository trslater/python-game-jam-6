# Python Game Jam #6

This is the repo for my entry to the [Python Game Jam #6](https://itch.io/jam/python-game-jam-6).

I have included a `Makefile` for convenience. These instructions all assume the use of the `Makefile`, but if you can't/don't want to use make, just inspect the `Makefile` to find the underlying commands.

## Development

```
make install
pyjam
```

## Building

```
make
```
